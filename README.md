# DataBases
For many years, databases have been the core of any information system. Appeared in the 80s,
relational systems have not stopped evolving. The objective of this course is to understand the problem 
of Databases and its necessary integration with other disciplines of computer science. It focuses on the relational systems that
today represent the safest technology in this field. The techniques that are presented highlight important concepts, such as:

* Data models   
* Data / application independence and levels of abstraction  
* Data and metadata  
* The structuring of the data   
* Information extraction, query languages and optimization  
* Integrity and consistency of data  
* etc   
* First ordered list item
* Another item
* Unordered sub-list. 
* Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
* Ordered sub-list
* And another item.
